    "ideal_answer": "Validity refers to the degree to which a research instrument measures what it is intended to measure. It ensures that the data collected truly represents the phenomena being studied. There are several types of validity:\nContent validity: Whether the instrument covers all relevant content areas.\nConstruct validity: Whether the test truly measures the theoretical construct.\nCriterion-related validity: Whether the results correlate with other accepted measures.\nReliability, on the other hand, refers to the consistency or stability of the measurement over time and across different situations. A reliable instrument will produce similar results under consistent conditions. Key forms of reliability include:\nTest-retest reliability: Stability over time.\nInternal consistency: Consistency among items in a test.\nInter-rater reliability: Agreement among different raters.\nIn marketing research, both validity and reliability are critical to making informed decisions. A study can be reliable without being valid, but for results to be useful, the research must be both valid and reliable.",
    "score": "7",
    "feedback": "The student provided a good overview of validity and reliability concepts in marketing research. The response is structured well and includes the main types of each concept. However, there are some areas for improvement."
